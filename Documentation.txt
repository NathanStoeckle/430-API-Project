What your site does and its purpose.
What my site is supposed to do is to allow users to create original characters with a basic template for easy usability

What part of your app does the API handle?
The app is supposed to be able to handle something called jQuery Flip by http://nnattawat.github.io/flip/, which would allow uses to have their character names on the front,
and other details on the back

What went right and what went wrong?
The general layout, and the starter code were probably the easy parts of the project, as I could modify it without much trouble
Also, I used a website, https://coolors.co/, to try to pick the best colors to go with white

The api part of the project is where things went wrong for the most part, I could not figure out how to get the card to be created, even though, I managed to create a format
so that it would be displayed like so. Initally, I thought that the fields were not clearing as well, until I modified the server.js file for further testing, and found
out that it did get modified easily.

If you were to continue, what would you do to improve your app?
Probably use a different api for a card flip. The documentation was pretty short, and there was not a whole lot to go off, plus, I had trouble creating the cards.

How did you go above and beyond?
Not applicable, due to time constraints (as well as getting sick 4 days before the project was due), I was not able to do something creative for above and beyond.
If I had, it would probably be something that I could allow for a search function, or something similar, to allow users to find a particular character for reference or to edit.
